    <h2>Common Garage Door Issues</h2>
    <p>Understanding the common issues can help you spot problems early. Here are the most frequent problems homeowners face:</p>
    <h3>1. Broken Springs</h3>

    <p>Cables help support the weight of the door. If they fray or snap, the door can fall suddenly and cause serious injury.</p>
